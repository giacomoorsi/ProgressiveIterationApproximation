1. DESCRIPTION

  GeoPDEs is an open and free package for the research and teaching of Isogeometric Analysis, written in Octave and fully compatible with Matlab.

  The GeoPDEs package provides a common and flexible framework for implementing and testing new isogeometric methods for the solution of partial differential equations.

1.1 FEATURES

  These are some of the main features of GeoPDEs:

    * Dimension independent implementation: the same code is valid for curves, surfaces and volumes.
    * Implementation of multipatch domains, with conforming interfaces.
    * Div- and curl-conforming spline spaces, also in multipatch domains.
    * Examples for Poisson, linear elasticity, advection-diffusion, bilaplacian, Stokes, Navier-Stokes, Maxwell and Kirchhoff-Love shells.
    * Adaptive methods with hierarchical splines.
    * Detailed documentation, accessible with the help command.

2. CONTENTS AND INSTALLATION

  Download and uncompress the file GeoPDEs_full.tar.gz. This file contains 
   all that is necessary to install GeoPDEs:
   - The GeoPDEs package: geopdes-3.2.2.tar.gz
   - The NURBS package: nurbs-1.4.3.tar.gz
   - The GeoPDEs-hierarchical package: geopdes_hierarchical-3.2.2.tar.gz
   - The technical report of GeoPDEs: GeoPDES-report.pdf
   - The technical report for hierarchical splines: GeoPDES-hierarchical-report.pdf
   - This README file.
   - For Matlab users, the mex files of the NURBS toolbox: nurbs_mex_files.tar.gz

    
2.1. OCTAVE

2.1.1 - Install
 
 * Install the "nurbs" package by typing at the octave prompt
    pkg install nurbs-<version>.tar.gz

 * Install and load GeoPDEs by typing at the octave prompt
    pkg install geopdes-<version>.tar.gz
    pkg load geopdes

 * Install and load GeoPDEs_hierarchical by typing at the octave prompt
    pkg install geopdes_hierarchical-<version>.tar.gz
    pkg load geopdes_hierarchical

2.1.2 - Note for Windows users

   The mingw-based binary version of Octave distributed on
    http://octave.sf.net by default installs dynamically loaded binary
    functions in a different location as that of script functions. This
    can create problems when installing GeoPDEs. In this case, we
    recommend you to use the non-compiled version of the package. 

 * Install the nurbs package, like in step 1 of Section 1.1.1.

 * Uncompress and untar the GeoPDEs package, and add to the path the 
    folder "geopdes", including its subfolders, typing at the octave prompt:
    addpath (genpath ('geopdes'))

2.2. MATLAB

 * Uncompress and untar the NURBS and the GeoPDEs packages, in the files
    nurbs-<version>.tar.gz, geopdes-<version>.tar.gz, respectively.

 * Add the generated folders to the path, including their subfolders. 
    You can do this by typing in in the command window:
    addpath (genpath ('nurbs'))
    addpath (genpath ('geopdes'))
    addpath (genpath ('geopdes_hierarchical'))

 * Install the mex-files for the "nurbs" package (OPTIONAL):
   - uncompress and untar the file nurbs_mex_files.tar.gz in the folder 
      "nurbs/inst" of the nurbs package
   - in Matlab, go to the folder "nurbs/inst" and run the script file 'compile'.
      This will compile the files and save the nurbs package to your Matlab path

3. GETTING STARTED

3.1. EXAMPLES

 * GeoPDEs contains a set of simple examples. Most of them can be run with the commands:
    geopdes_base_examples
    geopdes_elasticity_examples
    geopdes_fluid_examples
    geopdes_maxwell_examples
 
    These will guide you through a set of menus to choose some examples for solving different problems. 

 * The source code and the data files for these examples can be found in the directories:
    geopdes/inst/examples
    geopdes/inst/solve

 * A collection of simple geometries constructed with NURBS can be found 
    in the following directory:

     geopdes/inst/examples/geometry_files

3.2. HELP

 * A detailed documentation for the software is not likely to be published.
    We suggest you to read the paper

      R. Vazquez.
      A new design for the implementation of isogeometric analysis
      in Octave and Matlab: GeoPDEs 3.0, 
      Computers and Mathematics with Applications, 72 (2016), pp. 523-554
      doi:10.1016/j.camwa.2016.05.010

    In the paper we give an explanation of the architecture, the design and
    the main features of the code. This paper can be seen as brief user's guide.

 * For hierarchical B-splines, we suggest to read the paper

      E.M. Garau and R. Vazquez.
      Algorithms for the implementation of adaptive isogeometric methods
      using hierarchical splines,
      IMATI Report Series, 16-08 (2016).

 * All the functions in GeoPDEs contain a detailed description, that can be
    accessed with "help <function_name>". You can see a list of all the 
    functions in the package, typing in the Octave prompt:
     pkg describe -verbose geopdes
     help geopdes (if the package is not installed, also valid for Matlab users)

 * The format for the geometry files is explained in the files

     geopdes/doc/geo_specs_v21.txt      % Single patch geometry
     geopdes/doc/geo_specs_mp_v21.txt   % Multiple patches geometry
