%        boundary        (1 x 1 object)                a (ndim-1) dimensional "sp_multipatch" object for the whole boundary 
%        dofs            (1 x ndof vector)             only for boundary spaces, degrees of freedom that do not vanish on the boundary
%        orientation     (1 x ndof vector)             only for boundary spaces with 'curl-preserving' transform, global orientation
%                                                       of the boundary dofs with respect to the volumetric one.
%        constructor     function handle               function handle to construct the same discrete space in a different msh
%
