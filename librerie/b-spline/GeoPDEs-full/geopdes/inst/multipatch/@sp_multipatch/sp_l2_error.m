% SP_L2_ERROR: Evaluate the error in L^2 norm.
%
%   errl2 = sp_l2_error (space, msh, u, uex)
%
% INPUT:
%
%   space: object defining the space of discrete functions (see sp_multipatch)
%   msh:   object defining the domain partition and the quadrature rule (see msh_multipatch)
%   u:     vector of dof weights
%   uex:   function handle to evaluate the exact solution
%
% OUTPUT:
%
%     errl2:  error in L^2 norm
