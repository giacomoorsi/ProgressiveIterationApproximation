% SP_DRCHLT_L2_PROJ: assign the degrees of freedom of Dirichlet boundaries through an L2 projection, in multipatch geometries.
%
%   [u, dofs] = sp_drchlt_l2_proj (sp, msh, h, refs)
%
% INPUT:
%
%  sp:         object representing the multipatch space of trial functions (see sp_multipatch)
%  msh:        object containing the domain partition and the quadrature rule (see msh_multipatch)
%  h:          function handle to compute the Dirichlet condition
%  refs:       boundary references on which a Dirichlet condition is imposed
%
% OUTPUT:
%
%  u:    assigned value to the degrees of freedom
%  dofs: global numbering of the corresponding basis functions
