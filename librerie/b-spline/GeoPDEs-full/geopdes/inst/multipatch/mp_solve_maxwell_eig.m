% MP_SOLVE_MAXWELL_EIG: Solve the Maxwell eigenvalue problem with a B-spline discretization in a multipatch domain.
%
% Example to solve the problem
%
%    curl (1/mu(x) curl (u)) = lambda (epsilon(x) u)   in Omega
%      (1/mu(x) curl(u)) x n = 0                       on Gamma_N
%                      u x n = 0                       on Gamma_D
%
% where the domain \Omega is formed by several patches of the form F((0,1)^n).
%
% USAGE:
%
%  [geometry, msh, space, eigv, eigf] = 
%                  mp_solve_maxwell_eig (problem_data, method_data)
%
% INPUT:
%
%  problem_data: a structure with data of the problem. It contains the fields:
%    - geo_name:     name of the file containing the geometry
%    - nmnn_sides:   sides with Neumann boundary condition (may be empty)
%    - drchlt_sides: sides with Dirichlet boundary condition
%    - c_elec_perm:  electric permittivity (epsilon in the equation)
%    - c_magn_perm:  magnetic permeability (mu in the equation)
%
%  method_data : a structure with discretization data. Its fields are:
%    - degree:     degree of the spline functions.
%    - regularity: continuity of the spline functions.
%    - nsub:       number of subelements with respect to the geometry mesh 
%                   (nsub=1 leaves the mesh unchanged)
%    - nquad:      number of points for Gaussian quadrature rule
%
% OUTPUT:
%
%  geometry: array of geometry structures (see mp_geo_load)
%  msh:      multipatch mesh, consisting of several Cartesian meshes (see msh_multipatch)
%  space:    multipatch space, formed by several tensor product spaces plus the connectivity and orientation (see sp_multipatch)
%  eigv:     the computed eigenvalues
%  eigf:     degrees of freedom of the associated eigenfunctions
