% MSH_MULTIPATCH: constructor of the msh class for multipatch grids.
%
%     msh = msh_multipatch (meshes);
%     msh = msh_multipatch (meshes, boundaries);
%
% INPUTS:
%     
%     meshes:     cell-array of Cartesian meshes (see msh_cartesian)
%     boundaries: array of structures with the patch and side number for
%                   the domain boundaries (see mp_geo_load)
%   
% OUTPUT:
%
%     msh: object containing the following fields and methods
%
%     FIELD_NAME    (SIZE)                    DESCRIPTION
%     npatch        (scalar)                   the number of patches in the domain
%     ndim          (scalar)                   dimension of the parametric space
%     rdim          (scalar)                   dimension of the physical space
%     nel           (scalar)                   total number of elements of the partition
%     nel_per_patch (1 x npatch array)         number of elements on each patch
%     nqn           (scalar)                   number of quadrature nodes per element
%     nqn_dir       (1 x ndim vector)          number of quadrature nodes per element in each parametric direction
%     msh_patch     (1 x npatch cell-array)    the input meshes, a mesh object for each patch (see msh_cartesian)
%     boundary      (1 x 1 object)             it contains an (ndim-1)-dimensional 'msh_multipatch' object for the whole boundary
%     patch_numbers (1 x npatch array)         only for boundary objects, the volumetric patch to which the boundary patch belongs
%     side_numbers  (1 x npatch array)         only for boundary objects, the side number that the patch occupies in the volumetric patch
%     boundaries    (struct array)             information (patch and side) for each group of boundary sides (see mp_geo_load)
%
%     METHOD NAME
%     msh_evaluate_element_list: compute the parameterization (and its derivatives) at
%                       the quadrature points of a given list of elements.
%     msh_refine:       create a msh_multipatch object with a refined mesh.
