% NEWTONS_METHOD: Solve a non-linear system of the form f(x) = 0. The method 
% stops when |f(x)| < tol or the maximum number of iterations is reached.
%
% USAGE:
%
%  [x,err,it] = newtons_method (f,x0,jac,tol,maxit)
%
% INPUT:
%
%  f: function handler of the non-linear system
%  x0: starting vector
%  jac: function handler of the Jacobian of the non-linear system
%  tol: tolerance of the method
%
% OUTPUT:
%
%  x: solution such that f(x) = 0
%  err: residual of the last iteration
%  it: number of iterations
