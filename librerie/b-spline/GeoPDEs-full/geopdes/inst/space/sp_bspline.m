% SP_BSPLINE: Constructor of the class of tensor-product spaces of B-Splines.
%
%     sp = sp_bspline (knots, degree, msh, [transform, periodic_directions])
%
% INPUTS:
%     
%     knots:     open knot vector (cell array of size [1, ndim])
%     degree:    b-spline polynomial degree (vector of size [1, ndim])
%     msh:       msh object that defines the quadrature rule (see msh_cartesian)
%     transform: string with the transform to the physical domain, one of 
%                 'grad-preserving' (default) and 'integral-preserving', for N-forms.
%
% OUTPUT:
%
%    sp: object of the class sp_scalar, representing the discrete function space. See sp_scalar for details.
