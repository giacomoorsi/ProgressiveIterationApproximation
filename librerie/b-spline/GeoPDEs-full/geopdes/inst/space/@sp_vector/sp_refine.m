% SP_REFINE: construct a refined space from a given one. The function only
%                refines the space, the mesh must be refined separately.
%
%     [sp_fine, Proj] = sp_refine (space, msh, nsub, degree, regularity);
%
% The same number of subdivision is applied to each component. The degree
%   and the regularity may change.
%
% INPUTS:
%     
%     space:      the coarse space, an object of the sp_scalar class (see sp_vector)
%     msh:        an object of the msh_cartesian class, usuallly the refined mesh (see msh_cartesian)
%     nsub:       number of uniform subdivisions to apply on each knot span, for each direction
%     degree:     degree of the fine space, for each component and for each direction
%     regularity: regularity for the new space, for each component and for each direction
%   
% OUTPUT:
%
%     sp_fine: the refined space, an object of the class sp_scalar (see sp_vector)
%     Proj:    the coefficients relating 1D splines of the coarse and the fine spaces
%               and for each component. Cell-array of size ncomp_(param) x ndim
%
% If degree is not given, the same degree of the coarse space is used. If
%  regularity is not given, it is taken as degree minus one.
